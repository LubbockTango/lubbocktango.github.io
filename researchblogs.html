                        <p>
                            <div class='underline'>On Rehearsals:</div> What stood out to me the most, as an observer, was the ensemble's ability to communicate. While I have been in small ensemble settings myself, such as quartets or chamber groups, rarely have I seen such
                            a strong connection between so many players. It is already a challenge to maintain pulse and awareness between a handful of players- it's much more difficult with so many people. Plenty of groups their size (around 20 members
                            or so) have a director who is conducting the piece, at least to some degree. While Mr. Charles Olivier is the director of the TTU Tango Orchestra, he plays bandoneon within in the ensemble. This means that most of the time
                            no one is only conducting. The players use visual cues and eye contact to stay together, which is quite impressive considering some players are 10 feet apart or so.
                            <br/>
                            <div class='underline'>On interviews:</div> I was thoroughly blown away by the way that students in the Tango Orchestra answered the interview questions that they were asked. Many of them expressed a deep respect for the culture behind the music
                            and enjoyment for the program itself. I never anticipated that they would have the answers that they did and they exceeded my expectations. Both Adam Smith and Charles Olivier were very informative as far as what it's like
                            to participate in the Double T Tango ensemble as well as some of the history behind the music. I think we gathered some really helpful information from both sources.
                            <br/>
                            <div class='underline'>On the project itself:</div> This project has been a fantastic learning experience as far as the knowledge that I have gained about tango but also in terms of the skills that I have developed through working on this documentary.
                            I believe that the final product will certainly be indicative of all of the hard work and time that went into the production of the piece and look forward to seeing it.

                    <p>Over the past three months my honors Music and Globalization class has been working together to help the Texas Tech Tango ensemble create different medias to become more known throughout campus. My position in this team effort was
                        to be a field worker. My responsibilities included attending the tango ensemble rehearsals, making a timeline of a normal rehearsal and interviewing some of the members of the ensemble. I chose this position because I knew that
                        my weaknesses were mostly related to speaking to strangers because I am an extremely shy person. I wanted to force myself to "come out of my shell" during my first semester here at Texas Tech University, and I figured this position
                        as a field worker would do just that. My first step was attending the rehearsals, which was actually not bad at all. I enjoyed listening to the music that they were making and I also made many connections to how rehearsals run
                        in band. Since I am in band, I quickly picked up on the cycle of the rehearsals which is as follows: Charles, the director of the ensemble, would have the ensemble play through an entire piece and then they would go back and fix
                        the problem areas. During one rehearsal, I recorded the events that occurred and the times that everything happened. I used this to create a time sheet of the typical rehearsal for the website. The most difficult parts of my job
                        were the interviews. As I said before, I am extremely shy. It was so difficult for me to actually set up interview times because I was dreading it so much and, therefore, I procrastinated until I could no longer put it off. However,
                        once I did the interviews, I found that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Through this experience I learned that speaking to people is not bad at all. I just have to push myself to get what needs to be done done so that
                        it'll be finished sooner and then I won't be stressing about it when the project is almost due.</p>
