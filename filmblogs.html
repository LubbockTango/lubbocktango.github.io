                    <p>As a first-time director, I knew that this project would be a challenge to me. I had never put together a video before. The first thing I did was go observe a Tango Ensemble rehearsal. It was interesting to see how this ensemble rehearsed
                        compared to the other ensembles that I've been in. It seemed much more relaxed, especially since the conductor is also playing an instrument in the ensemble as well. What most people don't realize is how unique tango music is.
                        It can be very sweet or very rough sounding. I liked being able to see the music side of tango versus the dancing side of tango that people focus on more often. Although there is more focus on the tango dance, both are very important
                        to each other. Charles, the director of the tango ensemble, had placed importance on the musicians trying out a tango dance class to better understand the style. I had tried to play a tango piece before on my flute but I could
                        never quite get the style down... maybe I should have taken a tango dance class! Working on the video has been a great learning experience as well. I've gotten to learn a lot about how putting together a video works. There are a
                        lot of details that go into making a video look and sound professional. It has been great working with Noah on this project. I've learned a lot from him! Being a co-director is great because I get to see a lot of different parts
                        of the project come together into one, and I get to learn a little bit from each one! For example, I've also learned how to film in addition to being a director. Listening to the interviews has also taught me a lot about tango.
                        It was cool to hear about the genre from the perspective of a musician instead of just reading about it online somewhere. I'm glad to have been able to learn so much about the tango ensemble here at Tech as well as Tango in general!
                        I hope everyone will enjoy watching the video that we all put together!

                    <p>The documentary project has been a long and grueling process that has consumed much time. When we first began the project, I severely underestimated the amount of time it would take to complete the documentary project. I often collaborated
                        with Noah and Lillian while they constructed the basic structure for the documentary. I particularly enjoyed discovering the experiences that both Noah and Lillian brought to the storyboard discussions. It definitely strengthened
                        the vision for the documentary by combining multiple opinions and viewpoints. Additionally, I contributed to the documentary by tracking down third-party media sources that would enhance and heighten the quality of our documentary.
                        I drew from the atmosphere that Texas Tech University creates and the schism that separates traditional tango from the sensationalized version that is present today in the media. It has been a trying time this semester. Juggling
                        the adjustments to college while pouring hour outside of the classroom has made for a very strenuous and hectic semester. The hard deadline for the documentary has created a sense of urgency that has pressed myself and my fellow
                        classmates to create the best documentary possible. To summarize, this semester-long documentary project has allowed me to research a very interesting subject. But more importantly, the documentary has forced me to grow as an individual.
                        The things I have learned from the collaboration with my peers will apply to every aspect of my life in the foreseeable future. I hope you will enjoy the documentary, for it has been a labor of love!</p>

                    <p>As this semester draws near to an end and the due date of the tango class project, I have begun to remember all I have learned. For the project, I took part of filming interviews and footage from around the campus for the documentary.
                        During this experience, I have begun to see how much Americans take music from different cultures and countries and make it into something new. This is especially true for the tango. There is a huge difference between what most
                        Americans, including me, think about tango and the original tango. During this project, I recorded interviews for the most part which is when I did most of my learning. I mainly learned that Tango is not from Spain like I previously
                        thought, but instead comes from Argentina. I also learned that tango is used for dancing, but it is not as sexualized as Hollywood makes it out to me. Even when I went and recorded random interviews of people asking about tango,
                        most people would consistently think about dancing being associated with tango, but people's guesses about where tango originated is all over the place. My time working on the class tango project has been very eye opening about
                        how much American don't know about music in other countries, but instead make up their own explanations. </p>
