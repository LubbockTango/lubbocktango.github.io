                    <p> Throughout the research project my role hasn't been quite as important until we begin finishing each individual component of the website, such as the reports and transcripts, as I will be editing the final products. However, I have
                        learned much throughout the preparation of the website and the progress that others have made and my own research. Until now, I had always thought of Tango the way America portrays it, in a very sensual and romantic way with stiff
                        movements in the dancing and sharp staccato notes, and I always had the picture of someone of a man dressed in nice clothes with a red rose between his teeth. And through his dance, basically, "hitting" on a beautiful woman. That's
                        the scene I always associated with Tango. But since reading and researching, I realize that that is not how it started out when it originated in Argentina, that in fact it began in the rough part of the country as low-class! That
                        just shocked me. I have also learned how much goes into making a website. Hannah is so talented and has knowledge way beyond what I ever even thought about with technology, so it has been very interesting to see all that she has
                        come up with from scratch. I also have the job of writing the About blurb for the website, which will hopefully give an adequate summary of what there is to explore on the page. Throughout this project and the beginning of editing,
                        I have been forced to not worry about hurting the writers' feelings when I give criticism or offer a better way to phrase things, which has definitely been a challenge for me because I'm always worried about hurting feelings, but
                        this project has allowed me to understand how to be professional in delivering criticism, which will surely be very beneficial in the future. Another thing I have found so interesting throughout the project was the transformation
                        that the art of Tango has undergone. As I researched old Tango I came across some old footage on YouTube from an Argentinian film. In the film, which I'm guessing took place after the romanticizing of Tango began, there are many
                        couples dancing at what resembles an old dance hall and there is a Tango Orchestra band in the corner playing. Although there is a taste of romance the song is more about mostly about the music and there is less focus on the dancers
                        themselves. At this time in the video, very traditional style Tango music being played. This is opposed to the Tango of today's culture as seen in America, where Tango is a dance that can be performed to many different songs and
                        genres of music including the example I found from Dancing With the Stars, in which the popular song "Can't Keep My Hands to Myself" by Selena Gomez is used for the Tango Style Dance for the week. One thing I did notice that comes
                        through both examples was the level of exaggeration and drama that comes across. Tango is a very theatrical performance. It is just crazy to me how Tango has evolved from its humble beginnings to its stance of such beauty and expression
                        as its portrayed in the world today. I look forward to learning even more about the history and art behind Tango. </p>

                    <p>In this tango project, I learned an incredible amount of information about the music and culture of Tango, and developed experience and understanding in web design. I worked with a team of four people in charge of the website for this
                        project. My role specifically included researching and planning the layout for the content of the site, planning meetings for our group, and developing a logo for the project.
                        <br/>This project has taught me an incredible amount of knowledge over tango music that I would never have received in a typical classroom setting. Even as someone on the website team, I have learned interesting information over
                        the background of tango music, the traditional instrumentation of tango, other cultural influences in tango music, and the differences between traditional tango music and the modern tango music we know today that has spread across
                        the globe. I have a newly developed taste for tango music now, whereas before, I paid little attention to the music. Now, after listening to the Double T Tango Orchestra and researching the traditions behind tango music, I have
                        respect for the culture, and enjoy the music even more.
                        <br/>After viewing countless websites made for companies, music ensembles, colleges, etc. I found that making a good website that is both easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing is no easy task, and many people even fall short
                        in doing so. Through this project, I've learned to better appreciate a well-made website, but I've also began to more frequently notice poorly made ones as well. I more closely analyze the overall look and feel of a site, and found
                        that this is something crucial to the success of a company. If a website is clunky, and the layout is ugly, the company behind it looks unprofessional. With that in mind, we made sure to focus on a minimalistic design with our
                        site. This was to avoid bombarding the user with too many options, and to make the site run as smooth and simple as possible while still displaying all of the work by the students in our class.
                        <br/>Before the start of this project, I knew about Tango music, but I had never truly appreciated it. Afterwards, however, I have a new-found appreciation and respect for the music and culture associated with Tango music. If it
                        weren't for this tango project, I would have never gained the respect I have for Tango, and might not have ever enjoyed it like I do today. Thanks to the Double T Tango Orchestra and this project, I have learned a great deal of
                        knowledge over Tango and gained important experience in web development.</p>

                    <p>During this project, I have really enjoyed being a member of the web development team because it has allowed me to utilize and improve my web development skills as well as learn more about Tango music. User interface design and development
                        has never been a strength of mine compared to my other programming skills, so this project has been a challenge for me. Every time I have developed a website, I have always had someone with more experience helping me- but in this
                        project, I have been the expert. This has pushed me to do a lot of research and learning, and has also forced me to take a bit of a leadership role over this portion of the project. It was really intimidating at first, but when
                        I realized how well our team works together and how much everyone's skills offer different benefits to the project, I knew we were going to put together a great final product.
                        <br/><br/> I think the work our team has done is so unique because it is our responsibility to make sure everyone else's hard work is accessible, easy to navigate, and pleasing to look at. I know I have learned so much about Tango
                        simply by seeing all of the work the rest of our class is doing. As we near the end of this project, I cannot wait to see everyone else's accomplishments and bring them all together to form one cohesive product.

                    <p>For this project, I primarily worked with the web design team. I wanted to contribute to the aesthetic of the website, ensuring that it looked attractive and that it was easy to navigate. Because I have some amateur experience in photography,
                        I decided to utilize my skills and interest by taking some photos and by editing some pictures for the website. This included both atmospheric photography and photos of the Double T Tango ensemble. My atmospheric photos were primarily
                        compromised of pictures featuring Lubbock sunrises and pictures of Texas Tech's beautiful campus. For my photos of the ensemble, I took pictures of them both performing and practicing. I learned a great deal about both photography
                        and web design through my work. I was sometimes frustrated by my inability to take pictures that I was satisfied with. I often found it hard to take pictures of the whole group during practice and performance without sacrificing
                        a certain amount of aesthetic to the pictures. I overcame this challenge by changing my expectations of perfectionism, as well as by getting advice from skilled photographers that I knew. I used their advice to better capture the
                        group, and overall I am very satisfied with the result. <br/> The website design team comprised of Hannah, Tatum, Josh and I all were all able to learn from each other's experience, and we built off of everyone's interests and
                        skills. I was very impressed with Hannah's extensive previous knowledge of web design, and I learned a lot from her work and input. I am very satisfied with the website, and I believe that it has an appropriate aesthetic and utility,
                        as well as a plethora of good information regarding Tango and the Double T Tango orchestra. <br/> As for what I learned, I attended one of the Double T Tango orchestra's performances in order to take some pictures of the group.
                        I appreciated this experience because it allowed me listen to them perform in a professional setting, and it allowed me to have a greater understanding of the music involved with tango. Attending their performance changed my perceptions
                        of tango from my original idea that tango was compromised of over-sexualized music and dancing. I learned in my Music and Globalization class as well that Tango has a much richer background and culture to it, that accounts for
                        its unique sounds and rhythms. I appreciate tango so much more for what it is through my experience, and I enjoyed the opportunity expand my knowledge and grow my skills in photography. </p>
