Excerpts from Sydney Brammer's Field Notes
on the TTU Tango Orchestra

<div class='underline'>On Rehearsals:</div> What stood out to me the most, as an observer, was the ensemble's ability to communicate. While I have been in small ensemble settings myself, such as quartets or chamber groups, rarely have I seen such a strong connection between so many players. It is already a challenge to maintain pulse and awareness between a handful of playersâ€” it's much more difficult with so many people. Plenty of groups their size (around 20 members or so) have a director who is conducting the piece, at least to some degree. While Mr. Charles Olivier is the director of the TTU Tango Orchestra,  he plays bandoneon within in the ensemble. This means that most of the time no one is only conducting. The players use visual cues and eye contact to stay together, which is quite impressive considering some players are 10 feet apart or so.

<div class='underline'>On interviews:</div> I was thoroughly blown away by the way that students in the Tango Orchestra answered the interview questions that they were asked. Many of them expressed a deep respect for the culture behind the music and enjoyment for the program itself. I never anticipated that they would have the answers that they did and they exceeded my expectations. Both Adam Smith and Charles Olivier were very informative as far as what it's like to participate in the Double T Tango ensemble as well as some of the history behind the music. I think we gathered some really helpful information from both sources.
<br/>
<div class='underline'>On the project itself:</div> This project has been a fantastic learning experience as far as the knowledge that I have gained about tango but also in terms of the skills that I have developed through working on this documentary. I believe that the final product will certainly be indicative of all of the hard work and time that went into the production of the piece and look forward to seeing it.
